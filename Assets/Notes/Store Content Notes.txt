Meat Puppet - Humanoid Character Controller

- A locomotion and animation system for humanoid characters, especially NPC's
- Handles movement and pathing for a character
- Uses dynamic physics and collisions
- Can be used as a Third-person or FPS player controller
- Allows other scripts/systems to play arbitrary humanoid animations on the character
	- Can be blended over locomotion
	- Can be either one-shot or looping animations
	- Can temporarily affect corporeal/intangible and dynamic/kinematic
	- Can apply root motion from animation or not
- Unique spring and capsule structure allows the character to 'glide' over irregular terrain
- Handles most humanoid character needs so that messing with the Animation Controller isn't necessary
- Supports...
	- Jumping
	- Moving Platforms
	- Moving to one place while facing another
	- Walking and Running
- Setup involves:
	1. Add MeatPuppetManager prefab to the scene
	2. Add MeatPuppet component to the root of the character (alongside the Animator component, parent of the SkinnedMeshRenderer)
	3. Bake Unity Navigation Mesh
	4. Give the MeatPuppet a target destination and/or something to look at
	* (Optional) Add a MeatPuppet Player Controller component to the player

- corporeal/intangible

- dynamic/kinematic

	- dynamic + corporeal -> character will move using forces and collide with obstacles and other characters. Collisions will affect both's forces.
	- dynamic + intangible -> character will move using forces and will NOT collide with obstacles and other characters.
	- kinematic + corporeal -> character will move kinematicelly and collide with obstacles and other characters. Collisions will NOT affect this character, but WILL affect other dynamic obstacles and characters
	- kinematic + intangible -> character will move kinematically and will NOT collide with or affect obstacles and other characters.

- One-shot / looping animations
	- Argueably, %99 of what humanoid NPCs in a game will do can be covered by playing some animation on them. An attack is just a swing animation. Talking is just a looping animation of them in a discussion.
	- This system allows for two kinds of animations to be played on a character: 'One-shot' and 'looping'. Looping animations are any animation that starts over when it is finished and continuously plays forever. One-shot animations are the opposite; they play through once and then stop when they are finished.
	- One-shot animations can be used fire and forget
	- Looping animations must be 'stopped' at some point after they are started.
	- Looping animations can optionally (but are encouraged to) have an entry animation and an exit animation that more smoothly blends the looping animation with the locomotion animation.
	- If an animation (one-shot or looping) is started while a looping animation is in the middle of looping -> undefined
	- If a one-shot animation is fired while a one-shot animation is playing -> the new one-shot animation will interrupt and play over the old one
	- If a one-shot animation is fired while a looping animation is ending -> the one-shot animation will play as soon as the looping animation has finished
	- If a looping animation is fired while a looping animation is ending -> the new looping animation will play as soon as the old looping animation has finished
	- If a looping animation is fired while a one-shot animation is playing -> the new looping animation will play as soon as the one-shot animation has finished

* Recommended to use with:
	- FinalIK
	- UMA
	- Dynamic Bone
	- Obi Cloth

* NOT necessarily a universal controller. It is an NPC controller for this kind of NPC movement and interaction

* Demo scene:
	[-] Just animation controller (human stands in place, animation parameters are on on-screen sliders)
	[-] Walking up ramp(s)
	[-] Walking down ramp(s)
	[-] Walking over uneven terrain
	- Pushing dynamic obstacles
	[-] Being pushed by dynamic obstacles
	[-] Walking straight
		- Starting and stopping
	- Running straight
		- Starting and stopping
	- Walking in circles
		- Starting and stopping
	- Running in circles
		- Starting and stopping
	[-] Turning in place
	[-] Sit down and stand up from chair
	[-] Play one shot animation
		- Blended over locomotion
		- Overriding locomotion
	[-] Play one shot animation, interrupting a another
	[-] Play a looping animation
		- Blended over locomotion
		- Overriding locomotion
	[-] Using moving platforms
	- Climbing up:
		- Knee-high obstacle
		- Waist-high obstacle
		- Head-high obstacle
	- Climbing down
	- Different humanoids (models and sizes)
