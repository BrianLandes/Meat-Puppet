Meat Puppet Animation System

- Handles locomotion on the humanoid
	- Blends a standing - walking - running animation based on the velocity
	- Detects edges and automatically causes the humanoid to climb or hop over
		- Set height difference ranges cause one type or another:
			- Knee-high obstacle
			- Waist-high obstacle
			- Head-high obstacle
	- Slope of terrain effects lateral velocity
	- Uses dynamic physics - velocity and acceleration

- Allows other systems to fire one-shot and looping animations
	- PlayOneShotAnimation(animation)
	- StartLoopingAnimation(animation)
	- StopLoopingAnimation()
	- Optionally allows for configuration on...
		- Apply Root Motion
		- Make corporeal/intangible
		- Make dynamic/kinematic
		- Blend with locomotion

- Handles 'interactions' between the unit and interactable objects?
	- PlayOneShotInteraction(interactableObject)
	- StartLoopingInteraction(interactableObject)
	- StopLoopingInteraction()

- Handles 'interactions' between one meat puppet and another?

- Handles jumping and falling

- Handles the unit's dynamic <-> kinematic

- Handles the unit's corporeal <-> intangible

- Allows other systems to play a facial expression on the unit?

- Controls the humanoid's clothing (through UMA) and wraps manipulating with them?

- Controls the humanoid's state?
	- Whether they are...
		- Standing (default, typical locomotion)
		- Ragdoll
		- Crouching
		- Prone
		- Sitting down
		- Kneeling
		- Laying down on back
		- Laying down on front
		- Laying down on side

- Allows other systems to cause or uncause Ragdoll?
	- Active ragdoll?
	- Handles the transition from arbitrary ragdoll position to standing / standard locomotion

- Couples with the movement system
	- Allows other systems to give the unit world locations as navigation destinations
	- Allows other systems to give the unit a target direction or velocity
	- Uses Unity NavMeshAgent to pathfind
	- Uses Unity dynamic physics
	- Uses velocity and acceleration

- Uses a 'shock absorber' to give the humanoid a more natural vertical motion

- Comes with a Player controller so that all of this can be controlled by the player's input on a target character
